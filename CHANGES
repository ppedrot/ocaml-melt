Changes that may break existing programs are marked using a star *.

Version 1.4.0
=============

- Support for bytecode architectures.
- Fix detection of native dynlink.

Melt tool:
* The tool is now called melt-build instead of melt, to have the same name
  than in the Debian package.
- Added -native option.
- Bytecode compilation is now the default behavior. It is slower to execute
  bytecode, but much faster to compile.
- Fixed a bug where files would be left in the temporary directory.

Latex library:
- Added LaTeX commands: rule, llparenthesis, overline, ignorespaces.
- Better pretty-printing of [par] and [newpage].
- Added support for the optional argument (vertical alignment) of arrays.
- Support for the optional argument of parbox and minipage + doc minipage.
- Added size options to makebox and parbox + added raisebox command.
- ~short argument on chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection
- Primed versions of section, subsection and other such commands are now
  available. They correspond to the starred version of the LaTeX command.
- Added list_insert function.
- Introduce a new kind of (low-level) array line: array_command.
- Fix handling mode of the argument in multicolumn.

Melt library:
- Export Melt_commond.mode in Melt.Arg.

Mlpost interaction:
* Removed support for tex_dependencies in mlpost_on.ml.
  (It did not actually work and caused a bug.)
- Tweaks to compile without needing two passes.

Version 1.3.0
=============

The documentation has been updated and extended.

Known bugs:
* mlpost figures assume .1 filename extension when compiling with -ps.
  It works fine with mlpost up to 0.8.1, but not with the development version
  of mlpost which produce .mps files.
* bench/slides.mlt does not compile using mlpost 8.1 (it does with the
  development version) because the type of Box.pic changed. This should not
  bother you as this is just an example.
To sum up, choose your version of mlpost well.

Preprocessor:
* Percent character (%) now yields \% in .tex files, instead of just % which
would be a LaTeX comment. Lines being different in .mlt and .tex files, this
made no sense.
* Comments may be used in text and math mode. They use (* *) and may be nested.
- Bugfix: \n in verbatim mode is now handle correctly.
* \\ now yields a single \ in the .ml file

Melt tool and library:
- Programs which are compiled and linked with the Melt library now accept
  the -depends option on the command line. It produces, along with the
  X.tex file, a X.tex.depends file containing a hash of all Mlpost figures.
  If you have your own Makefile, you may add a dependency between the
  .ps or .pdf to this .tex.depends file to ensure the final document is
  recompiled if a figure changes.
- -classic-display is not passed to recent mlpost versions which do not
  handle it
* function "latex" has been renamed to "picture_of_latex", the "latex" value
  is now the \LaTeX command which prints the LaTeX logo
- Added -latex option to specify the latex command
* .ml files are only copied into _melt, they are no longer compiled
  nor executed. .mlt files are copied and preprocessed. They are not
  compiled nor executed either.
  If you need your auxiliary files to be compiled and preprocessed, just
  add them as dependencies of your main file (using "open" for instance,
  or adding a module initializer and calling it from your main file).
  They will then be compiled and linked by Ocamlbuild.

Latex library:
- implementation uses lists with fast concatenation, which should in particular
  help to prevent stack overflows
- packages used by commands in ~title, ~author, ~date and ~prelude of the
document function are now taken into account
- figure caption may be placed at the side (?side_caption)
- figures may be wide (?wide)
- wrapfigure, floatingfigure, subfloat
- beamer colors may be given using rgb values
- ~underscore argument for pseudocode verbatim function
- equation
- index_exponent
- variables (similar in use to LaTeX counters, but evaluated when
  pretty-printing the .tex file)
- empty, is_empty
- more delimiters, just_left, just_right, between
- index functionalities
- support of multicolumn via the 'layout' optional argument of 'array_line'
- Beamer columns
- and (many) various other latex commands

Other:
* module Version renamed to Melt_version
- man pages have been written, they are installed with "make install"
- fixed META file dependencies

Version 1.2.0
=============

Configuration, Compilation and Installation
- Default installation directory is now OCAMLLIB/melt, where OCAMLLIB is
either: the default installation directory of ocamlfind, or
the standard directory of caml if ocamlfind is not available.
- (bugfix) Do not link with mlpost if MLPOST = NO.

Melt tool and library:
- Add -latex file.tex option to Mlpost to compute prelude, if the tex file
already exists.
- Cairo support for Mlpost 0.7
* ?pdf argument for mlpost becomes ?mode
- -mlpost option
- -mlpost-no-prelude option

Preprocessor:
- Print opened and pending modes in unexpected end of file errors
- Print an error if a "}" appears in text or math mode

Latex library:
- (bugfix) the ~center option of figure has been fixed
- phantom, vphantom, hphantom
- Beamer overlays
- makebox, framebox
- unusual_command, for weird LaTeX commands with interleaved [] and {} arguments
or for commands with multiple optional arguments
- place_label to hackishly place a label
- latex_of_size for user-defined commands
* Latex.document does not add an empty \author{} if the ~author is not given

Version 1.1.0
=============

Configuration:
- Replaced the configuration tool by a more powerful one using Totoconf

Melt tool:
- -classic-display option
- Added the latop tool to parse LaTeX output and re-print it prettier and with
less trash (for now it is more or less deactivated though)

Preprocessor:
- \" in comments become " to stop the OCaml compiler from complaining about
a string litteral not terminated in a comment.
- $, " and { didn't work as verbatim delimiters and now a parse error is printed
- Errors are now printed as "Melt parse error" instead of just "Parse error"
- Underscores (_) are now accepted in verbatim function names

Latex and Melt libraries:
- Latex.Verbatim.pseudocode (and Melt.Verbatim.pseudocode)
* Bugfix: ~packages argument of commands and environment are now taken into
account even if the command is used deep inside the AST
* Bugfix: Melt.convert now forces math or text mode for `M and `T
- Latex.size type enhanced with more sizes
- Reorganized the interface and its documentation

Latex and Melt libraries (smaller features):
* inferrule_ replaced by inferrule, which has many new options
- parbox, minipage, center
- hspace
- bot
- textrm, textsf, mathcal
- newline_size
- Verbatim.trim, trim_end and trim_begin
- Verbatim.split_lines
- listoffigures, listoftables
- many more font size commands
- llbracket, rrbracket (package stmaryrd)
- box_

Version 1.0.1
=============

- Melt compiles with Ocamlbuild 3.10.0 even with the main Makefile.
- All combinations of -no-mlpost or -no-ocamlbuild options should work.
You still have to add "-I +mlpost" yourself if you compiled Melt with Mlpost
but use the -no-mlpost option.
- The -no-mlpost option is set by default if Melt was compiled without Mlpost.
