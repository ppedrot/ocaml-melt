TO DO
=====

* Protect the name of the verbatim functions when using the pragma.

The pragma
  ##verbatim '#' = test
should become
  let __meltpp_verbatim_delimiter_0 = test
and this fresh name should be used instead.

* Find a Unicode lexer. Menhir? Ulex of Alain Frisch?

* \left and \right for other kinds of parentheses

* itemize: newline after => latex error, par after => nothing (no par)

* Problem with make install who doesn't copy all files ?

* configure.ml should read Config

* Ocamlfind for install

* Default <# ... #> using texttt

* Really find out about the spaces at the beginning of lines in verbatim
mode, with or without Beamer

* Definitely get rid of textbf/mathbf and add "bf" (with a parameter, not like
the LaTeX \bf). The CMT mechanism should be able to handle this. Do the same
for it, sc, and so on.

* Better integration with Ocamlbuild. Maybe a symbolic link from _melt/toto to
the current directory, adding -I toto to the Ocamlbuild command?

* "display" command

* \addvspace bug: LaTeX complains about "perhaps a missing \item"

* _ and ^ support?

* Better compilation of new lines: prevent the "no line to end" error

* Melt.Verbatim.trim_end and trim_begin

* Prettier LaTeX pretty-printing

* Better error locations

* pseudocode option to manage identifiers such as T1, T2, T3 (for exemple:
give a function (t -> t -> t), default being the index function)
