TO DO
=====

* Protect the name of the verbatim functions when using the pragma.

The pragma
  ##verbatim '#' = test
should become
  let __meltpp_verbatim_delimiter_0 = test
and this fresh name should be used instead.

* Find a Unicode lexer. Menhir? Ulex of Alain Frisch?

* Syntax errors: write that it is a Melt syntax error

* \" in comments

* \left and \right for other kinds of parentheses

* itemize: newline after => latex error, par after => nothing (no par)

* Problem with make install who doesn't copy all files ?

* configure.ml should read Config

* Ocamlfind for install
