TO DO
=====

* Protect the name of the verbatim functions when using the pragma.

The pragma
  ##verbatim '#' = test
should become
  let __meltpp_verbatim_delimiter_0 = test
and this fresh name should be used instead.

* Find a Unicode lexer. Menhir? Ulex of Alain Frisch?

* Syntax errors: write that it is a Melt syntax error

* \" in comments

* \left and \right for other kinds of parentheses

* itemize: newline after => latex error, par after => nothing (no par)

* Problem with make install who doesn't copy all files ?

* configure.ml should read Config

* Ocamlfind for install

* Default <# ... #> using texttt

* Really find out about the spaces at the beginning of lines in verbatim
mode, with or without Beamer

* Try to build a pseudocode verbatim with some keywords and some things
that are not keywords. Check that the in "lettuce", "let" is not bold.
Try to do something where in "let x = toto", "let" is in bold, "x" is in italic,
the rest is normal. Finally, see if this really is easy to do.

* Definitely get rid of textbf/mathbf and add "bf" (with a parameter, not like
the LaTeX \bf). The CMT mechanism should be able to handle this. Do the same
for it, sc, and so on.

* Better integration with Ocamlbuid. Maybe a symbolic link from _melt/toto to
the current directory, adding -I toto to the Ocamlbuild command?
