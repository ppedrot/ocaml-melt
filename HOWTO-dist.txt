This file is only intended for developpers as a reminder of how to
make a release.

* Check that all text files are LICENSEd.

grep -L Copyright `darcs query manifest` | grep -v .png | grep -v .xcf         

Don't bother adding the LICENSE to very small files or files for which
licensing does not really make sense.

* Check the README.

* Check that there is no new, unrecorded file.

darcs whatsnew -ls

* Open melt_version.ml and update the version number if needed.

* Make the .tgz.

make dist

* Check that it compiles and executes.

tar xf (file).tgz
cd (dir)
make bench

(the slides need two passes, this is normal)

* Check noob.makefile. In particular, check that it does not contain
  any absolute path, and check that it compiles and execute.

* Check the list of changes and prepare a summary.

darcs changes --from-tag x.y

The CHANGES file should be up-to-date already, but this allows to make sure.

* TAG the version.

darcs tag x.y

* Create a new version on the forge with the summary of changes, and
  upload the .tar.gz to the OCaml Forge.

* Anounce the new version with the summary of changes.
