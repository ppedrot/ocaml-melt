Pre-requisites
==============

You need the OCaml compiler.  Version 3.09 is enough, maybe some
previous versions will work too.  Version 3.10.2 is needed if you want
to compile using Ocamlbuild.  Version 3.11 is needed if you want to be
able to use native plugins for the Melt Preprocessor.

To compile Melt documents you need a LaTeX distribution.

To compile Melt documents which use Mlpost figures you need the Mlpost
library. Versions from 0.6 to 0.7.4 are compatible. You will also need
its dependencies, such as Metapost and the "context" package (Ubuntu,
Debian, ...). Mlpost can be found at:

        http://mlpost.lri.fr

You can compile and use Melt without Mlpost, but you will need to
compile your Melt documents using the -no-mlpost option. If you later
install Mlpost and want to use it with Melt you will have to recompile
Melt.

Quick install (OCaml 3.10.2 or more)
====================================

make
make install

Quick install (Without Ocamlbuild)
==================================

make -f noob.makefile
make -f noob.makefile install

Configuration
=============

The configuration tool is automatically launched the first time you
run make. You can rerun it at any time by removing the Config file and
running make again, or by running:

        ocaml configure.ml -i

The -i option activates interactive mode.  If you don't use it,
default values will be used.

You can also edit the Config file by hand.

Documentation
=============

You can compile the documentation of Melt yourself. The manual can be
compiled with:

        cd bench
        melt -pdf doc.mlt

You obtain the file doc.pdf.

The library documentation is automatically compiled when you run
make. It can be found in:

        _build/latex/latex.docdir/index.html
        _build/melt/melt.docdir/index.html

or, if you compiled without Ocamlbuild:

        latex/latex.docdir/index.html
        melt/melt.docdir/index.html

Vim Plugin
==========

Vincent Aravantinos made a Melt plugin for the Vim text editor. You
can find it here:
